# Conclusion

We hope this section of the documentation succeeded in providing you a comprehensible overview of the intricate but powerful charging modes of evcc. While the dependencies between the different settings are not always easy to understand, they allow the system to adapt to many situations - the right setup is always a balance between many factors, among them: the output of your PV system, the consumption of your house and vehicle, the presence of batteries or other surplus controlled devices and the rates that apply to feeding power into the grid or drawing from it. With evcc you have a powerful tool at hand to accommodate these factors and optimize solar-charging of your vehicle based on your individual needs.
