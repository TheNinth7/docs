# `Minimum/maximum charging power` and `phases`

In the previous section, you saw that the `minimum charging power` is calculated from `minCurrent` and the `phases` setting. `Maximum charging power` is calculated from `maxCurrent` and `phases` and represents both the upper limit used in `Solar` mode and the power used for `Fast` mode.

If your charger supports automatic switching between 1-phase and 3-phase charging, you can set `phases=0`. With that, the system will use three phases if `available charging power` allows it, and otherwise only one.

Note that the `minCurrent` and `maxCurrent` settings apply to both 1-phase and 3-phase charging. Depending on the range of those settings in your system, youâ€™ll likely have gap between 1-phase and 3-phase charging, were evcc needs to continue charging with the `maximum charging power` of one phase and additional surplus has to be fed into the grid or a battery. 

The following diagram shows the calculations of `minimum charging power`, `maximum charging power` and the resulting gap between 1-phase and 3-phase charging:
