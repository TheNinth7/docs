# Minimum/maximum charging power

---
**What you'll learn**: how `minimum charging power` and `maximum charging power` are calculate and how this often leads to a gap between the power ranges usable for 1-phase and 3-phase charging.

---

`Minimum charging power` is calculated from `minCurrent` and the `phases` setting and represents the lowest amount of power the vehicle is charged with in `Solar` and `Min+Solar` modes. 

`Maximum charging power` is calculated from `maxCurrent` and `phases` and represents both the upper limit used in `Solar` and `Min+Solar` mode as well as the power used for `Fast` mode.

If your charger supports it, you can enable automatic switching between 1-phase and 3-phase charging. The system will then use three phases if `available charging power` allows it, and otherwise only one. In such a setup, `minCurrent` and `maxCurrent` settings apply to both 1-phase and 3-phase charging. Depending on the range of those settings in your system, youâ€™ll likely have gap between 1-phase and 3-phase charging, were evcc needs to continue charging with the `maximum charging power` of one phase and additional surplus has to be fed into the grid or a battery. 

The following diagram shows the calculations of `minimum charging power`, `maximum charging power` and the resulting gap between 1-phase and 3-phase charging:
