# Timing: multiple loadpoints

---
**What you'll learn**: how evcc manages multiple `loadpoints` with different priorities.

---

If you have two or more `loadpoints`, at each `interval` only one will be calculated and adjusted. This way each `loadpoint` represents its own independent control circuit. 

The control circuit of each `loadpoint` only takes into account the measurement inputs from the devices represented by the other loadpoints, but is not aware of their ongoing adjustments or delay timers. `Loadpoints` with lower priority may grab surplus before `loadpoints` with higher priorities, but the control circuits of the higher priority `loadpoints` wil recognize that and divert power.

The next diagram shows such independent control circuits for two `loadpoints`. In this example, we have Loadpoint A with lower `priority` grabbing surplus first but then releasing it again, after Loadpoint B with higher `priority` also starts charging:

Note that this back-and-forth can be avoided by setting a longer `enable:delay` for the `loadpoint` with lower `priority`:
