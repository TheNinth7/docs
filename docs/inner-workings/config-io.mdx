# Configuration and interactions

---
**What you'll learn**: in this section we'll introduce you to the different inputs and settings that define evcc's control of your vehicleâ€™s charging, especially in the `Solar` and `Min+Solar` modes. For that we'll leave aside the details of how devices are integrated with evcc, have a look at the [reference](../reference/configuration/) for a complete overview of that part of the configuration.

---

The following diagram shows the settings we'll discuss in the subsequent chapters of this section. Blue are settings that define integrations with external devices, for example meters, inverters, chargers, vehicles or batteries. Green are other configuration parameters controlling the logic inside evcc.

Evcc is just in process of migrating from file-based to user-interface-based configuration. Most parameters still need to be set in `evcc.yaml`, but the battery settings can already be done on the user interface and will be saved in the evcc database. 

The next diagram shows both configuration sources and interactions with external devices:

In the next chapters you'll learn in detail how the `Solar` mode processes these settings and inputs to exercise control of your charger.
