# Configuration and interactions

Have a look at the [reference](../reference/configuration/) for a complete overview of evcc's configuration. The following diagram shows the settings we'll discuss here. Blue are settings that define integrations with external devices, for example meters, inverters, chargers, vehicles or batteries. Green are other configuration parameters controlling the logic inside evcc.

Evcc is just in process of migrating from file-based to user-interface-based configuration. Most parameters still need to be set in `evcc.yaml`, but the battery settings can already be done on the user interface and will be saved in the evcc database. 

The next diagram shows both configuration sources and interactions with external devices:

In the next chapters you'll learn in detail how the `Solar` mode processes these settings and inputs to exercise control of your charger.
