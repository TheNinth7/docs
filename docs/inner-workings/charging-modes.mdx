# Charging modes

---
**What you'll learn**: what's the purpose of the the three charging modes `Fast`, `Solar` and `Min+Solar` as well as charging plans. A basic introduction can also be found in the [charging guide](/docs/guides/charging).

With evcc you can use one of the following three modes to charge your vehicle:

- `Fast` mode enables charging with the highest amount of power possible, without consideration of PV surplus. This mode basically replicates what the typical charger is already able to do on its own.

- `Solar` mode is where the magic happens: based on available surplus, evcc starts and stops the charging process and adapts the amount of power. If you have a battery you can set priorities between battery and EV charging.

- `Min+Solar` mode charges continuously with the minimum power needed by the charger, regardless of surplus. If more surplus is available, evcc will adapt the amount of power.

Charging plans are an additional option to control charging. Departure plans set a time when a certain charge limit shall be reached, the vehicle is charged in `Solar` mode with surplus and at the latest possible time `Fast` mode is activated to meet the targeted charge limit. With arrival plans the vehicle will be charged in `Fast` mode to a certain charge limit, and after that with surplus in `Solar` mode.

The following screenshot shows the selection of the charging modes:
