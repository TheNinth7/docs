# Introduction

In this section, we'll introduce you to the inner-workings of evcc and all you'd ever want to know about about customizing the charging process.

Let‘s start with why you‘d want to use evcc. In a nutshell: evcc takes control of your charger/wallbox and enables you to charge your electric vehicle (EV) with surplus from your photovoltaic (PV) system. Its power lies in its openness and the many interfaces implemented for different inverters, battery systems, vehicles and other energy-management equipment. This enables you to bring together hardware from different manufacturers and control EV charging at a level most similar systems cannot offer. 

Evcc is highly customizable, and can therefore adapt to many different setups and requirements. Before you read this sectioin, make sure you are familiar with the [structure of the configuration](../reference/configuration/). Here we will leave aside the details of how devices are integrated with evcc but will focus on how different inputs and settings define evcc's control of your vehicle’s charging, especially in the `Solar` and `Min+Solar` modes. 

## Table of contents

This inner-workings section of the documentation is divided into the following chapters:

|Chapter|What you'l learn|
|-------|----------------|
|[Charging modes](./charging-modes)|What's the purpose of the the three charging modes `Fast`, `Solar` and `Min+Solar` as well as charging plans.|
|[Configuration and interactions](./config-io)|What are the inputs and settings that define evcc's control of your vehicle’s charging.|
|[Minimum/maximum charging power](./minmaxphases)|How `minimum charging power` and `maximum charging power` are calculate and how this often leads to a gap between the power ranges usable for 1-phase and 3-phase charging.|
|[Available charging power](./available-charging-power)|How available surplus is calculated in `Solar` and `Min+Solar` mode.|
|[Starting and stopping charging](./startstop)|When evcc starts or stops charging your vehicle, and how in `Solar` mode this can be customized using `enable` and `disable` thresholds.|
|[Timing: interval and delays](./timing-interval)|How interval and delay settings affect when charging is started, stopped and charging power is adjusted.|
|[Timing: multiple loadpoints](./timing-multiple-loadpoints)|How evcc manages multiple `loadpoints` with different priorities.|

## Color codes

In the diagrams in this section, we'll use the following color codes:

- <font color="#5488EB">Blue</font> are settings that define integrations with external devices, for example meters, inverters, chargers, vehicles or batteries. 
- <font color="#70AD47">Green</font> are other configuration parameters controlling the logic inside evcc.
- <font color="#ED7D31">Orange</font> are computed values and outputs of evcc.
