# Introduction

In this section, we'll introduce you to the inner-workings of evcc and all you'd ever want to know about about customizing the charging process.

Let‘s start with why you‘d want to use evcc. In a nutshell: evcc takes control of your charger/wallbox and enables you to charge your electric vehicle (EV) with surplus from your photovoltaic (PV) system. Its power lies in its openness and the many interfaces implemented for different inverters, battery systems, vehicles and other energy-management equipment. This enables you to bring together hardware from different manufacturers and control EV charging at a level most similar systems cannot offer. 

Evcc is highly customizable, and can therefore adapt to many different setups and requirements. Before you read this page, make sure you are familiar with the [structure of the configuration](../reference/configuration/). In this section, we will leave aside the details of how devices are integrated with evcc but will focus on how different inputs and settings define evcc's control of your vehicle’s charging, especially in the `Solar` and `Min+Solar` modes. 

With that, let's dive right into the first chapter and have a look at those different charging modes.
