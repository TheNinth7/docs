# Timing: interval and delays

---
**What you'll learn**: how `interval` and delay settings affect when charging is started, stopped and charging power is adjusted.

---

The calculation of `available charging power` and resulting actions and adjustments are executed in the [`interval`](../reference/configuration/interval/) defined in the configuration file. Therefore evcc does not react to any change in the inputs but only to the state detected at each interval, as the next diagram illustrates:

The time in between the `intervals` gives the charger or other device represented by the loadpoint as well as other surplus-controlled devices chances to react before the state is checked again and further adjustments are made.

To avoid vehicle charging being started and stopped in the typically relatively short `intervals`, several delays are applied:

- [`loadpoint.enable:delay`](../reference/configuration/loadpoints/#delay) defines the time the enable threshold must be met before charging is started. Also applies to switching from 1-phase to 3-phase charging.
- [`loadpoint.disable:delay`](../reference/configuration/loadpoints/#delay-1) defines the time the disable threshold must be met before charging is stopped. Also applies to switching from 3-phase to 1-phase charging.
- [`loadpoint.guardduration`](../reference/configuration/loadpoints/#guardduration) defines the time that after starting charging must pass before charging can be stopped again, and vice versa the time that must pass after stopping before charging can start again.

The next diagram shows the application of those settings and their relationship with the control cycle `interval`:
