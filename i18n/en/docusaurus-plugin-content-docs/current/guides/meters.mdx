# Meters / Site

### Are my metering devices supported?

Hopefully (and relatively likely!). Have a look in [Devices - Meters](/docs/devices/meters) to see if your device is listed.
If it isn't, try a configuration using a generic interface, or a similar device from the same brand.

Many Inverters are Sunspec-compatible (even if it sometimes needs to be enabled), so it's worth trying to find out whether yours supports either this or another generic communication standard.

### I have a solar installation, but I don't have a (readable) grid connection meter - can I still use evcc?

Sure! But please note that you won't be able to charge using Solar Excess energy only, as the calculations required for this are only possible when Grid Power is known.
When configured like this, evcc will charge the vehicle using the current power coming from Solar Generation.

A typical, medium-sized house's consumption can be specified to attempt to leave some energy for your house - you can do us this using the
[`residualPower`](/docs/reference/configuration/site#residualpower) config flag.

**Example**:

```yaml
site:
  residualPower: 250 # 250W house consumption
```

### I don't have Solar panels - can I still get use out of evcc?

Possibly! evcc has plenty of uses beyond pure Solar diversion. **Please note that all of these use cases require a Grid connection meter.**

Here's some ideas:

- Automatically charge a vehicle depending on the current price of energy using a variable rate electricity tariff (such as Octopus Energy, Nachtstrom, Twibber, Awatter, etc.) - see [Configuration - Tariffs](/docs/reference/configuration/tariffs)
- Remotely start / stop your charger - especially useful on those Chargers that don't have any other remote control interface
- Limit charging your vehicle to a certain State of Charge - but please note that having your Vehicle configured is essential.

### I don't yet have a inverter / Charger, can I try evcc out?

Sure! We have a selection of "dummy" components that can help fill in gaps. Refer to [demo.yaml](https://github.com/evcc-io/evcc/blob/master/cmd/demo.yaml) for some ideas.

Here's an example using the `const` plugin:

```yaml
meters:
  - name: dummymeter
    type: custom
    power:
      source: const
      value: 700 # 700W
```

And another one using the `script` plugin:

```yaml
chargers:
  - name: my_charger
    type: custom
    status: # charger status A..F
      source: script
      cmd: /bin/sh -c 'echo b'
    enabled: # charger enabled state (true/false or 0/1)
      source: script
      cmd: /bin/sh -c 'echo false'
    enable: # set charger enabled state (true/false or 0/1)
      source: script
      cmd: /bin/sh -c 'echo false'
    maxcurrent: # set charger max current (A)
      source: script
      cmd: /bin/sh -c 'echo 10'
```

### I have a Grid meter, but my Solar Inverter is very old and doesn't offer a usable data interface. Can I still use evcc sensibly?

Yes! If there's a Grid meter and a controllable charger, then you can use all of evcc's essential functionality - including Solar Excess charging.
Please note that you will be lacking a few visualizations and statistics, including the calculation of solar charging percentage.

Do consider that if you install a retrofitted meter of some kind (such as a Shelly EM) onto your inverter's output cable, you'll get all of the same functionality that you would
if you could talk directly to the inverter.
